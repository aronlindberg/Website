**Two main types of factor analysis**

There are a two main types of factor analysis - PCA (principal components analysis) and PAF (principal axis factoring). PCA tends to be more useful when the objective is dimension reduction while PAF is primarily used to identify latent dimensions or constructs. (Hair et al 2009: 107-108)

**Rotation**

In order to determine the best solution your factors needs to be rotated. There are two main ways of rotating your factors, orthogonal (factors are uncorrelated) and oblique (factors are allows to correlate). Most commonly we use the latter, implemented through a method such as OBLIMIN in SPSS.

**Sample size**

In order to determine how large a sample size you need for a certain level of factor loadings to be considered as significant, refer to Table 3-2 on p. 117 in Hair et al (2010). Here we can see, that if your sample size is 85, then you need a factor loading to be at least .60 to be considered significant.
