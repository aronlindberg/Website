Univariate and multivariate assumptions
===

!

Why are they important?
---

* Affect the veracity of your analysis
* SISO
* Statistical methods will not work without them 

!

Univariate assumptions
---

1. Normality
2. Adequate variance
3. No systematically missing variables
4. No outliers

!

Multivariate assumptions
---

1. Linearity between IVs and DVs
2. Homogeneity of variance across groups
3. Constant error variance
4. Normal error variance
5. Multicollinearity

!

Normality
---

* -3 to 3 for skewness
* -8 to 8 for kurtosis

!

Adequate variance
---

* < 90% of observations have the same value

!

No systematically missing variables
---

* MCAR
* MAR

!

No outliers
---

* Outliers
* Influential cases
* Cooks' D <1
* No gaps in Mahalanobis distances, insignificant values (p1 in AMOS)

!

Multivariate Assumptions
===

!

Linearity between IVs and DVs
---

* Quadratic and cubic fit lines no more than 2% better

!

Constant error variance
---

Differences < 1:3

!

Normal error variance (residuals)
---

* -3 to 3 for skewness
* -8 to 8 for kurtosis

!

Multicollinearity
---

* Tolerance levels > .1

!
