Exploring Configurations of Affordances in Software Development
===

!

The Problem
---

* Lack of a cumulative research stream on affordances of technology
* Affordances most commonly considered in isolation

!

Background
---

1. The origin of the affordance construct
2. Lack of consistent definition
3. Lack of empirical application
4. Most often considered in isolation
5. Some intimations of affordance sets exist

Affordance Ecologies
---

1. Infrastructure domain (toolsets)
2. Organization domain (technological frames)
3. Practice domain (affordances in performances)

!

Affordances
---

* Representation
* Analysis
* Transformation
* Control
* Cooperative
* Storage

!

Research setting
---

* Agile (small toolset, iterative approach)
* Waterfall (large toolset, linear approach)

!

Findings
---

* Affordances form sets roughly as often as they occur individually
* Agile has a smaller lexicon of affordance configurations
* Waterfall has a

!

Further research
---

* MCAR
* MAR

!

No outliers
---

* Outliers
* Influential cases
* Cooks' D <1
* No gaps in Mahalanobis distances, insignificant values (p1 in AMOS)

!

Multivariate Assumptions
===

!

Linearity between IVs and DVs
---

* Quadratic and cubic fit lines no more than 2% better

!

Constant error variance
---

Differences < 1:3

!

Normal error variance (residuals)
---

* -3 to 3 for skewness
* -8 to 8 for kurtosis

!

Multicollinearity
---

* Tolerance levels > .1
