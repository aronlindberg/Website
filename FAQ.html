<p><strong>How much statistics (SPSS/AMOS etc.) should I attach to my paper?</strong></p>

<p>It&#8217;s tricky to determine just how much information you need to give the reader. Generally you need to avoid the extremes of either giving the reader all the information you used during your analysis raw (information overload!), or not giving any details at all and just handing over your conclusions. In the first case you are basically asking the reader to do the analysis for you, and in the latter case you are saying &#8220;Trust me! I got this&#8221;. You want to give the reader just as much information as is needed for him to follow your argument and to be able to critically evaluate it, without having to redo the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>In my path analysis, the modification index for two error variances is really high. Can I covary them?</strong></p>

<p>In model development, every modification of the model needs two components: a statistical justification (AMOS gives you this), and a theoretical justification. Without a theoretical justification for adding a path, you might just be capitalizing upon artifactual variance in your particular dataset.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get the SRMR statistic in AMOS?</strong></p>

<p>Click Plugins &gt; Standardized RMR. This will bring up an additional window in which the SRMR will be displayed as soon as you run the analysis.</p>

<p><strong>How do I get indirect/total effects in AMOS?</strong></p>

<p>You need to run a bootstrap. Click Analysis Properties &gt; Bootstrap. Then check &#8216;Perform Bootstrap&#8217; and &#8216;Bias-corrected confidence intervals&#8217;.</p>

<p><strong>When do I need direct/indirect/total effects in AMOS?</strong></p>

<p>You need these when you want to establish mediation. First you test for the direct effect, to establish that there is an initial relationship to mediate (i.e. whether it is significant or not). Then you place the mediator between the initial IV and DV, run the model again and check for the indirect effect. If your indirect effect is insignificant, there is no mediation. However, if your indirect effect is significant then you have a mediation on your hands. If the direct effect has become insignificant, then your mediation is full, otherwise it is partial.</p>

<p><strong>When do I want to use a bootstrap in AMOS?</strong></p>

<p>Bootstrapping gives you indirect and direct effect, but that is just a peculiar characteristic of AMOS. You could test the same things using the Sobel test. However, bootstrapping is in general used when your sample size is small, and you want to artificially boost its sample size. Remember that this is a measure-of-last-resort, since it tends to create bias in your analysis.</p>

<p><strong>When do we use squared multiple correlations?</strong></p>

<p>Squared multiple correlations measure the fraction (% if you multiply by 100) of variance in a variable that its predictors explain.</p>

<p><strong>When do we use factor score weights (factor loading)</strong></p>

<p>A factor loading measures how strongly a certain item (variable) correlates with a latent factor. It is used when we are trying to determine how well a certain factors explains the variance across several variables.</p>

<p><strong>What do I do if I don&#8217;t know what a number/statistic in AMOS means?</strong></p>

<p><strong>When do we test for Common Method Bias?</strong></p>

<p>Once you have put your measurement model in AMOS you can create a common factor, load all items on it, and see how well the single factor explains your data. The variance that can be attributed to your single factor can be attributed to common method bias and any artifactual variance.</p>
